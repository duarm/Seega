# Seega
an African board game, Created in partnership with IFMS

The objective of this project was to expose the african culture through its games, the project was presented as a lecture at IFMS on Brazil. Featuring decoupling as a proof of concept in Unity.

Since this game is a learning project, there's probably lots of bad design choices, but even so, the project was completely migrated from 3d to 2d with 1 modification, being the only a physics tied one, since we can't mix 2d and 3d physics.
