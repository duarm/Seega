# Seega
an African board game, Created in partnership with IFMS

This project was an extension work at school, aiming to expose the african culture through its games, the project was presented as a lecture at IFMS on Brazil. Featuring decoupling as a proof of concept in Unity.

Since this game is a learning project, there's probably lots of bad design choices, but even so, the project was completely migrated from 3d to 2d with 1 modification, being the only a physics tied one, since we can't mix 2d and 3d physics.

The results are pretty satisfatory, the behaviour can be easily modified by adding and removing components, and new behaviour can be added  by implementing an interface. Combining the Open/Closed principle with any DI framework can lead to a really fun project to work with and extend.
